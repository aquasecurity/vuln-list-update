    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An incomplete fix was found for the fix of the flaw CVE-2020-1733, Ansible: insecure temporary directory when running become_user from the become directive. The provided fix is insufficient to prevent the race condition on systems using ACLs and FUSE filesystems.\n            STATEMENT: Ansible Engine 2.7.18, 2.8.12, and 2.9.9 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nAnsible Tower 3.4.5, 3.5.6 and 3.6.4 as well as previous versions are affected.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 no longer maintain their own versions of Ansible. The fix will be provided from core Ansible. However, we still ship Ansible separately for Ceph Ubuntu.\n            MITIGATION: Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue.",
