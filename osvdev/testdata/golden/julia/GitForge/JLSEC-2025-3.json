These inputs are not validated or safely encoded and are sent directly to the server.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis means a user can add path traversal patterns like `../` in the input to access any other endpoints on `api.github.com` that were not intended.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade immediately to v0.4.3. All prior versions are vulnerable.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\nFixed by: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/GitForge.jl/pull/50 (which is available in v0.4.3).\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to *splitline* from the DEVCORE Research Team for reporting this issue.","affected":[{"package":{"name":"GitForge","ecosystem":"Julia","purl":"pkg:julia/GitForge?uuid=8f6bce27-0656-5410-875b-07a5572985df"},"ranges":[{"type":"SEMVER","events":[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"0.4.3"}]}],"database_specific":{"source":"https://github.com/JuliaLang/SecurityAdvisories.jl/tree/generated/osv/2025/JLSEC-2025-3.json"}}]}
