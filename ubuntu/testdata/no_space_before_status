Description:
 In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into
 changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early; a consecutive call
 to XML_GetCurrentLineNumber (or XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber) then resulted
 in a heap-based buffer over-read.
Ubuntu-Description:
 A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in
 XXX-PACKAGE-NAME-HERE-XXX. If a user were tricked into opening a specially
 crafted XML file, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial
 of service or execute arbitrary code.
